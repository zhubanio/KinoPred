# Raw data files (if 'raw_movie_files' is a large dataset you don't want in Git)
# Only add this if you're sure you don't want to track these large files.
# For small, version-controlled datasets, sometimes they are tracked.
# For large datasets, it's better to store them separately (e.g., S3, Google Cloud Storage, DVC).

.DS_Store # macOS
Thumbs.db # Windows
